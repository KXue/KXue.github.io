						<p>
							Hello, please pardon the mess. I'm still in the middle of renovating. I'm trying to use div transitions and transformations
							to create a nice looking layout without bootstrap, but I can't seem to find any good colour schemes to fit each tab. Just look at how
							hideously saturated that orange tab is! Finding a decent font colour and icon colour that matched each tab took a while too. I wouldn't mind any suggestions for making this layout look nicer.
							Contact info in the slightly less hideously saturated orange page.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am a candidate for Bachelor of Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Enjoys coding on the front end, especially 
							for mobile devices. Experienced with Objective-C, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Familiar with C/C++, the Unix/Linux environment and pig-latin.
							Passionate about making anything I'd be proud to use.

				<h1>Not Really Sure What to Do Here Yet...</h1>
				<div class = "info">
					But my goodness this background sure is saturated! It could be the sleep deprivation, but it's making my eyes hurt.
					<h2>Growth Mindset:</h2>
					In hindsight, I'm don't think this design is all that great. Too many colours are required which ultimately lead to the eye pericing orange.
					However, I really do like that page swapping effect. Maybe if I used dark pages and a lighter font...
					<br>
					There's definitely a lot more work to be done. I haven't implemented the back end nor have I added PDF readers, blog readers, etc.
					<br>
					It seems like having the tabs swap places is a bit confusing from a UX standpoint. It looks cool and it makes sense (kinda), but maybe I should give them fixed locations
					so I don't have to look up and just use memory instead when clicking on tabs. But hey, <i>I don't always take you where you wanted to go, but I always took you where you needed to be.</i> (paraphrased from Doctor Who season 6, episode 4: The Doctor's Wife)
					<br>
					If you noticed the use of the golden ratio, good for you! The content width and height are 62% (~1/1.618) of the width and height of the page. The widths of all 4 tabs combined is also 62% of the width of the page (15.5% each). However, I'm not sure if any perceived improvement in aesthetics is outweighed by the loss of space.
