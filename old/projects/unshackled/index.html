                    Unshackled
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A class project made in Swift Spritekit for iOS. The player uses swipes to move and jump and taps to shoot. 
                    Shooting propels the player backwards with recoil which the player can use to boost their jumps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I did:</strong> Programming and design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I'm proud of:</strong> The swipe controls has potential. Solving collision problems relating to Spritekit was interesting 
                    as well
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What needs work:</strong> While the swipe controls has potential,it requires a lot more polish and prototyping to actually be 
                    viable for tight platforming. The level design needs work as well.
                </p>
