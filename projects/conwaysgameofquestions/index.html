                    Conway's Game of Questions
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A game jam project for PTBO Game Jam 2 (Theme: fake news) made in Unity in collaboration with 
                    Ben Goodwin (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/smalltowndojo">@Smalltowndojo</a>). In this simple endless 2D platformer,
                    you dodge flying microphones firing words relating to the "fake news" and political memes of the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I'm proud of:</strong> As my first Unity project, I had a lot to learn developing this 2D "platformer"
                    without platforms. I spent most of the jam experimenting with cool ways to move such as wall jumping, dashing, air dashing,
                    double jumps, and a blink mechanic; all of which I'm quite happy with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What needs work:</strong> The rest of the game is quite lacking. The game loop and loss condition were
                    slapped in as a last minute consideration. Balancing was nonexistent and I've received feedback saying that the game was too easy.
                </p>
