                <h1>
                    Git Gud
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A class project made with two classmates in Java for Android. In this bullet hell game, the player uses the touch screen
                    to move the player to dodge enemies and their bullets. The player can two finger tap to stop time. In stopped time, the player can trace a path.
                    When time resumes, the player follows the traced path. Any enemies or bullets touched while following the traced path are destroyed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I did:</strong> Programming (engine), design, task management, git related technical help. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I'm proud of:</strong> Building the engine and solving its related problems was rewarding, especially since this engine is technically 
                    multithreaded. I had to implement spatial hashing to make the engine fast enough to perform collision detection for all the bullets and enemies. 
                    The time stopping mechanic, the path tracing, and simulating where the enemies would end up as the player follows the traced path were
                    also interesting problems to solve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What needs work:</strong> As my first group project, I had problems making the game while managing the team and project. As a result, the game 
                    overshot the deadline by a week. I also had to teach my team to use Git, hence the project name "Git Gud".
