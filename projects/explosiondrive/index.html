                    Explosion Drive
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A game jam project for The Game Maker's Toolkit Jam (Theme: dual purpose design) made in Phaser. In this game, you
                    use explosions to propel your spaceship and enemy spaceships alike. Once propelled by an explosion your ship can ram into enemy spaceships,
                    destroying them and propelling you faster. However, you die if hit from the sides or back, or if you're not going fast enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I'm proud of:</strong> I think the use of explosions complements touch interfaces which was one of the requirements I set myself.
                    With better polishing, an interesting mobile game probably could have come of this. The time stop and screen shake additions also really contributed
                    to the game feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What needs work:</strong> The code was buggy and difficult to read. The game would often break on loss or wouldn't load properly. I 
                    was using an unfamiliar version of Phaser as well as attempting to use it with an ES6 boilerplate.
