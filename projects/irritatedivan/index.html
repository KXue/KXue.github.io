                <h1>
                    Irritated Ivan
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A text based roguelike made in C++ as a class project. As Ivan, you navigate a procedurally generated cave, eating 
                    mystery jerky and fighting hostile pigs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I'm proud of:</strong> The procedural generation and its problems were my favourites to solve. The caves were created using a two step 
                    cellular automata. I also used some JSON parsing to define parameters for the procedural generation. The enemy and item distribution problems were also 
                    interesting to solve. I ended up using something like a lottery system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What needs work:</strong> I wanted to not rely on any terminal/operating system specific code so the game could be fully portable. However, the 
                    accessibiity of the game suffered greatly as the player had to fully type out the command rather than use key presses to move or attack. I also initially
                    planned an autocomplete function using a trie data structure, but that turned out to be useless. I also suffered from scope creep and the project was finished
                    late.
