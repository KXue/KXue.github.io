                <h1>
                    The Lost Box
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A networked co-operative top down hack'n slash made in Unreal Engine for class made by the entire class. You play as one of four characters co-operatively 
                    (like Gauntlet) as you navigate through a dungeon of monsters and traps in search of the "Lost Box".
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I'm proud of:</strong> That we actually managed to make a nice game on time given all the production issues in a team of this size. We had many merge issues due to the binary 
                    nature of Unreal assets. Managing a team the size of a class was difficult. Personality clashes and other teamwork issues frequently had to be resolved. I also had to get the AI 
                    system working on the last day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What needs work:</strong> While we tried to follow an agile methodology, much of the communication required for agile was missing during this project. Knowing more about 
                    agile now, I would have managed and structured the team differently.
                </p>
