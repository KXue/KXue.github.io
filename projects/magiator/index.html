                </h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A networked PVP third person shooter made in Unity with a partner for class. Two players dodge and 
                    shoot fireballs at each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I'm proud of:</strong> This was my first networked project. I had a lot of fun figuring out the networking problems such as 
                    syncing animations. I liked the UI as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What needs work:</strong> The game has no real win condition, and lacks many of the staples of a networked game (lobby, chat, 
                    game over screen, scores). In order to avoid scope creep and to deliver on time, I had to cut the game down to a MVP.
